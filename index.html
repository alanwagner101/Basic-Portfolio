            <!--Bio-->
            <p id="p1">My name is Alan Wagner. I grew up in a small town named Casselton 20 miles west of Fargo, ND. I moved to Minneapolis 5 years ago with my wife. My wife recently completed schooling for cosmetology and has been working at a salon in uptown. I have been working in sales at a home improvements company in St. Anthony. I recently decided to pursue one of my dreams of working with technology and join a coding bootcamp. I am very excited for the doors this might open for me.</p>
            <p id="p2">My hobies include many outdoor activities such as hiking, kayaking, skateboarding, fishing, and riding motorcyle. I also play several instruments, love video games, and enjoy binge watching tv series.</p>
            <p id="p3">My goal in life is to work in a field that makes me happy and also makes me enough money to support my wife and I. I thouroughly enjoy watching the technological advances we make as a civilization and think it would be thrilling to be a part of it even in a small and insignificant way. I think this course will definitely push me in the right direction and give me the skills I need to create and manage amazing content.</p>
